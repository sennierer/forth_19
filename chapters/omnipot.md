- ACDH is involved in many heterogeneous DH projects
	+ a LOT of legacy data in wild formats, using even wilder vocabularies and ontologies
- \>\> interlink as much data as possible, to allow for harmonized views on the combined datasets
- Idea of the omnipot:
	+ Start with (partial) mapping of selected datasets to CIDOC CRM
	+ Serialize the rest creating an ad hoc Ontology based on e.g. column- and table-names
	+ Use metaphacts/researchspace to find overlaps
	+ and take the interlinking from there
