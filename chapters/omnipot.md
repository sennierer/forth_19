- The Austrian Academy of Sciences was founded in 1847 @css[fragment](\>\> a LOT of legacy data in wild formats, using even wilder vocabularies and ontologies)
- interlink as much data as possible
- Idea of the omnipot:
	+ Start with (partial) mapping of data to CIDOC CRM
	+ Serialize the rest creating an ad hoc Ontology based on e.g. column- and table-names
	+ Use metaphacts/researchspace to find overlaps using temaples and fields
	+ and take the interlinking from there
